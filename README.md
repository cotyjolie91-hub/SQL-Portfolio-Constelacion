# 🎮 Video Game Market Analysis (SQL Portfolio)

## 📌 Project Overview
An exploratory data analysis of the video game industry using a dataset of 16,500+ games. 
The goal was to identify market leaders, platform wars winners, and genre profitability using **SQL (Aggregations, Grouping, and Math Functions)**.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
* **`1_top_games.sql`**: Identifies the best-selling titles of all time.
* **`2_top_consoles.sql`**: Analysis of the "Console Wars" (Total sales by Platform).
* **`3_genre_metrics.sql`**: Advanced analysis comparing Volume (Total Games) vs. Efficiency (Revenue per Game).

## 💡 Key Insights Found
1.  **PlayStation 2** is the undisputed market leader in hardware history.
2.  **Wii Sports** success proves the value of bundling software with hardware.
3.  While **Action** games generate the most total revenue, **Shooters** yield a higher return on investment per individual title.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **SQL (SQLite):** Group By, Order By, Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT).
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling CSV headers and data types.
